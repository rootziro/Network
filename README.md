# Network
These are projects learned and studied from Black Hat Python by Justin seitz. 

Here I will demonstrate my personal progress in Python scripting through the guide of the BHP book.
The purpose of these projects is to gain the habit and knowledge on having to script network based solutions during a black box test or any other inconvienences during a pentest; such as a tcp server.
